            <h3>"My boyfriend totally surprised me!"</h3>
            <p>
            I was having such a crappy day...that is until I got this little delightful package in the mail! I was complaining to my boyfriend the whole day about how awful everything was going and knowing I am a die-hard sailor moon fan, he sent this as a surprise!! Turned what was supposed to be the worst day ever into the best!

            <p>
            Whenever I feel like I deserve a reward, I treat myself to one of these customized bento boxes. I've already tried all their premade boxes and they're all wonderful! But I love that I have the ability to make the box perfect for me!

            <p>
            I still can't get over how cute this is. I would order these every day but my mom would kill me if she found out I liked these better than her cooking. I've marked down all her vacations onto my calendar so I can make orders everyday.

            They're seriously too cute to eat! Whenever I order them, my friends and collegues are always filled to the brim with jealousy.

             What the heckkkkkkkkk. Everything is TOO. FREAKING. CUTE. Like, I love pokemon (everything pokemon). Seriously, I would trade my soul to become a pokemon. When I found that they had POKEMON BENTOS, I freaked out. I pretty much spent all my paychecks on bento boxes now and I don't regret it at all!

            <h3>"My 5 year old loves these"</h3>
            <p>
            I ordered the mario bento for my 5 year old set and when the delivery man came with this package, my son thought it was pure magic! His face was beaming and I was genuinely worried for his cheeks from how hard he was smiling! I had to promise him I'd have another one sent again before he would even eat it! On top of how cute they were, they were so tasty (I sneaked a bite when he wasn't looking)! Most definitely will order again!

            <p>
            I have just received a beautifully presented box of a truly scrumptious lunch! My gorgeous friend ordered them for me for my birthday and I want you to know how much I have appreciated all your time and effort on her behalf – thank you! I will be using you in the future for equally special occasions and people.

            <p>
          My mum and I ordered me a custom jigglypuff box for my 18th in October. I just wanted to say thank you so so much as they were absolutely amazing! We were amazed that they arrived so quickly as we left it such last minute! I had people asking me all evening where I got them from as they were (and still are!) the best bentos ever.

            <p>
            Thank you for the safe and very prompt delivery of my order No.3451. Which I first discovered  at the Summer Homes & Gardens Fair at Osohe Castle in Tazmily. They are, without any doubt, the best and most luxurious bentos on the planet and I have certainly done some serious research. Congratulations on a brilliant product!

          We bought some bentos for our company conference and they went down so well! Fantastic customer service, gorgeous little boxes tied up with ribbon in the company colours and most importantly delicious bentos! Fabulous, will be back in touch for more next year.
