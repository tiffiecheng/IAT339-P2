            <h3>"My boyfriend totally surprised me!"</h3>
            <p>
            I was having such a crappy day...that is until I got this little delightful package in the mail! I was complaining to my boyfriend the whole day about how awful everything was going and knowing I am a die-hard sailor moon fan, he sent this as a surprise!! Turned what was supposed to be the worst day ever into the best!

            <h3>"I love my custom bento box"</h3>
            <p>
            Whenever I feel like I deserve a reward, I always treat myself to one of these customized bento boxes. I've already tried all their premade boxes and they're all wonderful! But I love that I have the ability to make the box perfect for me!

            <h3>"To die for!!!"</h3>
            <p>
            I still can't get over how cute this is. I would order these every day but my mom would kill me if she found out I liked these better than her cooking! I anticipate her vacations so I can order them everyday all day!

            They're seriously too cute to eat! Whenever I order them, my friends and collegues are always envy with jealous!

            <h3>"Oh my godddd"</h3>
            <p>
             What the heckkkkkkkkk. Everything is TOO. FREAKING. CUTE. Like, I super love pokemon. Like everything pokemon. Seriously, I would trade my soul to become a pokemon. When I found that they had POKEMON BENTOS, I freaked out. I pretty much spend all my paychecks on bento boxes now and I don't regret it at all!

            <h3>"My 5 year old son love these!"</h3>
            <p>
            I ordered the mario bento for my 5 year old set and I swear to god, when the delivery man came with this package, he thought it was pure magic! His face was so happy and I was genuinely worried for his cheeks from how hard he was smiling! I had to promise him I'd have another one sent again before he would even eat it! On top of how cute they were, they were also extremely delicious (I sneaked a bite when he wasn't looking)! Most definitely will order again!
